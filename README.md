With our game the player will play as a researcher 
and must identify different animals in the estuary.
Once the player identifies an animal they will gain more
information on the animal by completing various tasks. The
goal is to identify a certain number of animals in a given time
frame.

GitHub Etiquette message from Dixit

0. The first relevant commit to your "master" should ideally be just the folders and "skeleton" of your classes (i.e. just the empty java files as per your UML diagram and nothing more) in those folders. You should structure this in Eclipse before pushing to your remote repo.
1. "master" is the branch that represents "stable" code. So, no direct commits or changes should be done in "master" unless absolutely necessary.
2. If you need to add new code, create a new branch off master (or a relevant existing branch) and make your changes there.
3. Commit your changes locally, and push it to the same named branch on remote repo. Always "pull" first before pushing.
4. When you think you have completed something, or just need a review from your teammates, create a pull request.
5. When someone else from your team has successfully reviewed your code, it can then be merged to the master. If not ready to be merged, you can continue making changes suggested by your teammate(s) on the same branch and the pull request will automatically reflect those changes, until you are eventually ready to merge it.
6. Treat your pull request as a discussion board. Add comments and suggestions on the pull request as required.
7. You can tidy things up after successful merge and delete the branch if it is no more relevant.

Handling and Avoiding Conflicts from Dixit

0. Always "pull" before pushing any changes to remote.
1. A branch is owned by a developer to implement their own list of responsibilities. Minimize the overlap in the code to be written as far as possible.
2. Multiple developers should not be working on the same thing (writing/editing same methods, attributes) on different branches. If it is a must to work together on a code segment, make a person take lead, and work on the leader's branch only.
3. Consider merging two (or more) branches first before creating a pull request to merge changes to master.
